Sneed SNS dApp

  ```motoko    
# To install and run tests locally:
    git clone https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp
    cd sneed_sns_dapp
    npm install
    dfx start 

# In a new console, also in sneed_sns_dapp directory:
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_backend --specified-id "bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_frontend --specified-id "bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_tests --specified-id "by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_old_token_mock --specified-id "b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_new_token_mock --specified-id "br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_old_indexer_mock --specified-id "bw4dl-smaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai"
    dfx deploy sneed_dapp_new_indexer_mock --specified-id "be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai"

# Then, to run the tests:
    dfx canister call sneed_dapp_tests run_tests

# A return value of () means all tests ran successfully. You can also check the first console in which you ran dfx start to see the test output. 

# To test that state is preserved between updates:
    dfx canister call sneed_dapp_backend burn_old_tokens '(1_000)' 

# It is expected that this call returns an error: (variant { Err = variant { NotActive } })

# Then check the log size before and after updating the canisters:    
    dfx canister call sneed_dapp_backend get_log_size
    dfx deploy
    dfx canister call sneed_dapp_backend get_log_size

# Make sure that get_log_size returns the same number both calls, and that it is a value greater than zero (expected value would be 2).
